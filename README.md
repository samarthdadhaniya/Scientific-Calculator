## Run Locally


- Open any code Editor you can work with and open a Terminal in that editor.

<br>


Go to the project directory :

```bash
  cd my-project
```

<br>

Now initialise an empty git repository with this command :

```bash
  git init
```

<br>

Clone the project :

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```
<br>

: ) After creating the clone, you are free to modify the code as you see fit.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `my-project`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.

```
